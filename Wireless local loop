 • Implementation of a local loop especially in rural areas used to remain a risk for many operators due to less users and increased cost of materials. The loop lines are copper wires which require more investments.
• However today with Wireless local loop (WLL) has been introduced which solves most of these problems. 
• As WLL is wireless, the labor-charges and time-consuming investments are no longer relevant.
• WLL systems can be based on one of the four below technologies:
1. Satellite-based systems.
2. Cellular-based systems.
3. Microcellular-based Systems
4. Fixed Wireless Access Systems 
• The WLL architecture is shown below:
• The given architecture consists of three major components i.e WANU, WASU and SF
• Wireless Access network unit (WANU): the WANU consists of various components which include 
1. several base stations transceivers or radio ports (RP) 
2. a Radio port control unit 
3. an Access manager (AM) 
4. an HLR. 
• It provides various functionalities like:
1. Authentication 
2. Air interface privacy 
3. Over-the-air registration of subscriber units. 
4. Operations and Maintenance 
5. Routing 
6. Billing 
7. Switching functions 
8. Transcoding of voice and data. 
• Wireless access subscriber unit (WASU): It provides an air interface UWLL towards the network and a traditional interface TWLL towards the subscriber.
• The power supply for it is provided locally. 
• The interface includes 
1. protocol conversion and transcoding 
2. authentication functions 
3. signaling functions 
• The TWLL interface can be an RJ-11 or RJ-45 port.
• The UWLL interface can be AMPS, GSM, DECT and so one.
• Switching Function (SF): The switching function (SF) is associated with a switch that can be digital switch with or without Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) capability, an ISDN switch or a Mobile Switching Centre (MSC).
• The AWLL interface between the WANU and the SF can be ISDN-BRI or IS-634 or IS-653 or such variants.
Deployment Issues:
• To compete with other local loop technologies WLL needs tom [provide sufficient coverage and capacity, high circuit quality and efficient data services.
• Moreover the WLL cost should be competitive with its wireline counterpart. 
• Various issues are considered in WLL development which include:
1. Spectrum: The implementation of WLL should be flexible to accommodate different flexible bands as well as non-continuous bands. More these bands are licensed by government.
2. Service quality: Customer expects that the quality of service should be better than the wireline counterpart. The quality requirements include link quality, reliability and fraud immunity.
3. Network Planning: Unlike Mobile System, WLL assumes that user is stationary, not moving. Also the network penetration should be greater than 90%. Therefore WLL should be installed based on parameters like Population Density etc. 
4. Economics: Major cost here is electronic equipment’s. In current scenario, the cost of such electronic equipment is reducing periodically.
• In traditional telephone networks, your phone would be connected to the nearest exchange through a pair of copper wires.
• Wireless local loop (WLL) technology simply means that the subscriber is connected to the nearest exchange through a radio link instead of through these copper wires.
